Let's start over. Prompt:

I want to display an image on my domain, with a logo/button as external link to my main site, a title to appear and an audio behind. I'm using the GitHub repo we've created yesterday. I'm going to edit the index.html and style.css as you will instruct me to.

Here is the detailed context:

1. Background

The background image is horizontal for web/laptop screens. For mobile/smaller devices, it should be cropped/positionned centered centered. 
Display: it should be displayed full screen, use media query or anything helping you to adjust the best way so that it covers the entire space/window of a user's display.

2. Audio

I have an audio file to play on a user arrival, it should be set to a low volume, such as 20%. A control to activate or deactivate the music (Sound icon for 'on' and Mute icon for 'off', in bright yellow and a hard black stroke to be readable. The audio control should be located top left-hand corner. 
Display: appearance of the audio control should be transparent to opaque from left to right (like if it was sliding in), with a delay of 1 seconds on a user's arrival. The appearance of the control launches the audio at set volume in a fade-in/crescendo way. Softly

3. Logo
It will have the Logo on overlay (PNG with spaces around) which will have to be locked in the bottom-right corner, it will redirect to main-site @ zazzlelabs.io
Display: appearance of the Logo should be transparent to opaque from bottom to top, with a delay of 2 seconds on a user's arrival.

4. Title
I need a title in PNG to display at the middle of the superior third of the image, layer should be displayed full-width (I'd add spaces both sides so that the image is pixel perfect positioned) 
Display: appearance of the title should be fade in from left to right, with a delay of 3 seconds on a user's arrival.

That's it.
